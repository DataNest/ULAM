# Extra stuff for debian install

# Strategy 20150713: This is completely and obviously awful (if also
# painfully typical) but it appears a seriously non-finite task to do
# anything else, so we're basically going to put the entire MFM tree
# under /usr/lib/ulam/MFM.  ulam needs a _lot_ (though strictly
# speaking not _all_) of the MFM tree at _runtime_, including
# executables plus .h's, .tcc's, .inc's, and Makefiles.  At the
# moment, those are all intertwined under MFM_ROOT_DIR relative
# references -- which this way, at least for now, will continue to
# work.  Then we do symlinks in /usr/bin for the programs.
